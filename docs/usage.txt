Antenna Pointing Client Usage:

Requires:
pymavlink, pyserial, argparse, pprint, etc.
Solution:
pip install [required package name]

usage from CMD:
python AntennaPoint/PointerClient.py --serialout COM16 --gpsdevice COM22/
    --device 127.0.0.1:14502 calibrate||stream

calibrate: Runs the calibration routine from the antenna pointing mbed.
This routine must be run before doing anything.

stream: Scans GPS position of antenna from the GPS microcontroller over serial connection,
and sends azimuth/elevation angles to the antenna controller microcontroller
over serial connection. Depends on antenna mbed being properly calibrated.

--serialout: The serial COM Port for the antenna microcontroller (COMxx)

--gpsdevice: The serial COM Port for the gps microcontroller (COMxx)

--device: network address for MAVLINK packets from the Pixhawk. This connection
comes from a UDP port sent out by MAVProxy. (127.0.0.1:1450x)
